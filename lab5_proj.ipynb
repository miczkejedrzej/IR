    "### Description of testing\n",
    "\n",
    "We tested several movie recommender systems, which are described step by step along with the conclusions drawn from the results. To evaluate the prediction accuracy of the systems, we devised several evaluation methods. All methods are based on 10-fold cross-validation on user ID 610. This involves running 10 iterations of the recommender systems, each using 9/10 of the records for user ID 610 (along with all records for other users) to predict the scores for deliberately erased data for user ID 610. We calculate the error for each iteration and take the mean error across all 10 runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While using data from other users could provide more insights, our task specifically focuses on predicting ratings for movies for user ID 610. Therefore, the evaluation is solely based on the algorithms' errors for this user ID. When creating the splits for 10-fold validation, we do not shuffle the data, as it is not sorted by rating for user ID 610. Consistent splits are used across evaluations to enable fair comparisons between different recommender systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We employ several error evaluation methods, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** A straightforward and easy-to-interpret measure of prediction error.\n",
    "- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** A measure that penalizes larger errors more heavily, making it well-suited for this purpose.\n",
    "- **Weighted MAE:** This approach accounts for the user's preferences. For instance:\n",
    "  - If the user is selective and values precision in high ratings, overestimation errors may be more detrimental.\n",
    "  - Conversely, if the user watches many movies and values variety, underestimating high ratings (false negatives) may be more problematic.\n",
    "  To address this, we calculate the MAE with weights applied to overestimation and underestimation errors, allowing us to analyze which systems perform best for high precision or high recall in high ratings. To isolate each type of error, we use weights such as (1,0) for overestimation errors only and (0,1) for underestimation errors only.\n",
    "- **MAE for Top-K Rated Movies:** This measure focuses on the K highest-rated movies. The rationale is that users may care less about ratings for movies they wouldnâ€™t watch anyway. This is especially relevant for selective users with limited time, who prioritize avoiding low-quality movies while being less concerned about films they wonâ€™t watch.\n",
    "\n",
    "These evaluation methods enable us to comprehensively assess the performance of the recommender systems and identify the most suitable approaches for specific user preferences and scenarios."

The first system sets the prediction for the tuple (user ID, movie) as a weighted average of ratings for the given movie from users who have watched the movie and had a positive correlation with the given user, with a correlation value above a certain threshold. We will test several correlation thresholds to determine which one performs the best."

    "#### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach offers some advantages over the baseline method; however, the improvement in MAE is not dramatic, approximately ~10%. The RMSE decreases by an even smaller percentage. Nonetheless, the predictions are noticeably more balanced, with the difference between underestimation and overestimation errors being negligible compared to the baseline. Additionally, the error for the top 10 predicted ratings (p=10) decreases significantly, which is important in real recommender systems, as these are the movies the user is most likely to watch based on predicted ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, in nearly all metrics, setting the threshold to 0 (thereby including all positively correlated users) yielded the best results. Conversely, limiting the calculation to users with a positive correlation > 0.6 sometimes performed worse than the baseline, with a higher RMSE. This might be due to data sparsity: users with high correlation may have only a few movies (e.g., three) in common with user ID 610, making them less reliable as sources of information."

    "### Using negatively correlated users\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the limited availability of data, it would be beneficial to leverage users who are negatively correlated with the current user. There is a significant number of such users, and we devised an algorithm to utilize them effectively. The approach involves using positive correlations as in the previous method but also incorporating users with strong negative correlations (i.e., users whose correlation magnitude exceeds a certain threshold).\n",
    "\n",
    "To include negatively correlated users in the weighted average, we do not directly use their ratings. Instead, we transform their ratings using the formula `rating = 6 - rating`. This adjustment reflects the expectation that if a strongly negatively correlated user rates a film highly, the current user is likely to rate it low, and vice versa. In essence, we create a complement of the original rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation is applied only to ratings from strongly negatively correlated users in the ranges (0,2] and [4,5). For example, if a strongly negatively correlated user rates a movie as 3, applying the formula would still result in a rating of 3 (`6 - 3 = 3`), which does not align with the expected behavior. To avoid such inconsistencies, these middle-range ratings are excluded from the adjustment process."

To address this, we need to consider how the rating for the film we are currently evaluating deviates from the given usersâ€™ rating means.

    "\n",
    "This turned out to be a very effective approach. The MAE decreased visibly, and the RMSE improved even more significantly, dropping from the previous best of around 0.79 to 0.68 now. The overestimation and underestimation errors are very similar and significantly lower than before, which is also a very positive outcome. The error for the top 10 ratings decreased slightly, but only marginally compared to its previous best value. Overall, this approach seems to perform the best so far, as it minimizes error across all metrics, making it not only a good but also a versatile method.\n"

    "### Item analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, why not analyze the items as well to improve our algorithm? The idea here is similar to the previous algorithm but with an added twist. After calculating the weighted deviation for a given (user ID, movie) tuple, we check if the score is equivocal. To clarify, consider an example: if the average weighted score suggests 3.2, it would be rounded down to 3 because this is the closest viable rating. However, it may also not be far from 3.5. In such a case, we check the mean value for this item (movie) to determine if it is above 3.5. If so, we set our average to 3.5. This approach allows for rounding up in scenarios where user behavior analysis is torn between two ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This addition of item analysis to the algorithm appears to be a great idea because it addresses ambiguity in user behavior where the scores are close to the rating boundary."

    "The difference compared to the previous method is not very striking. The MAE is slightly improved, but on the other hand, the RMSE is slightly worse, and the MAE at the 10 best ratings is also slightly lower. The underestimation error is lower than ever before, indicating that this system tends to overestimate, which could be the best choice for a user who is not very picky but wants to have a broad set of well-rated films to watch. In general, this idea seems quite interesting but likely requires more testing to make a significant difference."

    "- We believe that we thoroughly tested several recommender system approaches, often building one upon another. The main conclusion is that the system based on the weighted average of deviations from the means for the 25 most correlated users performs the best. It is definitely the most versatile, performs well across all metrics, and is the top performer in some specific metrics, such as RMSE, which is an important measure for this problem.\n",

    "- Additionally, item analysis is a very promising idea. Even a simple conflict resolution approach using the mean for the given movie, applied when the weighted average of users yields an equivocal score, proved to be promising. With further work and testing, better results could likely be achieved using an item-based recommender system combined with a user-based one. We also tried combining a user-based recommender system based on correlation with an item-based recommender based on cosine similarity between movies. However, it turned out to be even more computationally expensive than the user-based recommender systems, leading us to abandon that approach.\n",
